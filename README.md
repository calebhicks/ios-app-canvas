## The Canvas

The canvas helps students create a proper development plan from idea, considering functionality, designing the model, designing views, and writing the method signatures for the controller objects. The canvas also provides a tracker section for completing each step.

### Idea

What key problem does your app solve?
How does your app solve that problem?
Who is your target user? Be specific.
How have you validated the problem and your solution with your target user?

### Specific Functionality

What key features are required for your minimum viable product? Keep it simple.
What features may be interesting for future versions?

### Model

What data do you need?
Where will you get that data?
Will your data be stored locally or remotely?
How is your data related?
How will your data be represented in your app?

List all model objects with properties and initializers.

### View

What views do you need to create to meet each feature in your app?
How will the user get to each view?

Revisit this regularly. Simplify each time. Focus on the user.

Draw each view and map out how the user will get to each of them.

### Controller

What controllers will you create for your app? (Consider controllers for your model, network, purchase, datasource, and other specialized features.)
What will each controller need to do? 

Write out properties and method signatures for each controller object.

### Tracker

In what order will you finish each step? Build in the suggested order unless you have a strong reason not to.
When will you finish each step?
